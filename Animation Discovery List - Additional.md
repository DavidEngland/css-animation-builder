## Missing Animation Search Results

**Note**: The `dangleFall` animation was not found in the current file excerpts. It may be in files not captured in the workspace scan, or might be in a different naming convention.

**Recommended Search Locations**:
- Check SCSS files in `assets/scss/` directories
- Look for custom animation files in theme folders
- Search for "dangle", "fall", "drop", or "hang" variations
- Check demo HTML files for custom keyframe definitions

## Implementation Notes

- Many animations have both entrance and exit variants
- Several animations include "Big" versions for more dramatic effects
- Border animations are particularly sophisticated with multiple visual layers
- Animation accessibility is well-considered with `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- Utility classes exist for duration, delay, and iteration customization

## Next Steps

1. Search for `dangleFall` in additional file locations
2. Prioritize unique animations not commonly found in other libraries
3. Consider implementing the typewriter effect as it's highly engaging
4. Focus on border animations as they provide unique visual appeal
5. Test animations across different browsers and devices
