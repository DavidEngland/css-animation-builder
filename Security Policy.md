- Nonce verification for AJAX requests
- Sanitized database interactions

## Security-Related Configuration

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
```http
Content-Security-Policy: style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
```

### WordPress Security Headers
```php
add_action('send_headers', function() {
    header('X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff');
    header('X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN');
