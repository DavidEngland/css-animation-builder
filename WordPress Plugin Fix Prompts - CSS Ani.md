# WordPress Plugin Fix Prompts - CSS Animation Builder

## ðŸ”§ **Critical Missing Files Prompt**

**Prompt:** "I have a WordPress plugin for CSS Animation Builder that's partially working. The shortcodes are registered but the JavaScript and CSS files are missing. I need you to create the complete asset files for:

1. **typewriter.js** - TypewriterAnimation class with character-by-character typing
2. **handwriting.js** - HandwritingAnimation class with handwriting effects
3. **animation-builder.js** - Main animation builder interface
4. **frontend.js** - Frontend utilities and initialization
5. **admin.js** - WordPress admin interface functionality
6. **typewriter.css** - Typewriter animation styles with cursor blink
7. **handwriting.css** - Handwriting styles with font variations
8. **animation-builder.css** - Animation builder UI styles
9. **frontend.css** - General frontend styles
10. **admin.css** - WordPress admin styles

The plugin shortcodes are: `[typewriter]`, `[handwriting]`, and `[css-animation-builder]`. Each shortcode generates unique IDs and data attributes for JavaScript initialization."

## ðŸŽ¨ **Animation Enhancement Prompt**

**Prompt:** "I want to enhance my WordPress CSS Animation Builder plugin with advanced typewriter and handwriting effects. Currently I have basic character-by-character typing. I need:

**Typewriter Enhancements:**
- Realistic typing speed variations (fast/slow/pauses)
- Backspace/delete/correction animations
- Multiple typing cursors (|, _, â–ˆ, â–Œ)
- Sound effects integration (optional)
- Code syntax highlighting while typing
- Multi-line typing with proper line breaks

**Handwriting Enhancements:**
- SVG path-based writing animation
- Different pen types (fountain pen, ballpoint, marker, pencil)
- Ink flow effects and paper texture
- Pressure-sensitive line thickness
- Realistic writing speed and pauses
- Cursive connection between letters
- Signature-style animations

Create modern, performant JavaScript classes that work with WordPress shortcodes."

## ðŸ”¨ **WordPress Integration Prompt**

**Prompt:** "I need to fix WordPress integration issues in my CSS Animation Builder plugin. Current problems:

1. **Shortcode conflicts** - Multiple shortcodes on same page interfere
2. **Asset loading** - CSS/JS files not loading properly in WordPress
3. **Admin interface** - Need proper WordPress admin page with live preview
4. **Security** - Need proper nonce verification and sanitization
5. **Performance** - Assets loading on every page instead of only when needed
6. **Mobile compatibility** - Animations not working on mobile devices

The plugin structure is:
```
css-animation-builder/
â”œâ”€â”€ css-animation-builder.php (main file)
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ js/ (JavaScript files)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ css/ (CSS files)

```

Fix these issues with proper WordPress best practices, conditional loading, and mobile optimization."

## ðŸŽ¯ **Specific Fix Prompts**

### **Asset Loading Fix**
**Prompt:** "My WordPress plugin CSS Animation Builder has asset loading issues. The shortcodes generate HTML but JavaScript files aren't loading properly. I need conditional asset loading that only loads scripts when shortcodes are actually used on a page. Show me how to implement proper WordPress asset enqueueing with dependency management."

### **Shortcode Conflict Fix**
**Prompt:** "Multiple instances of my animation shortcodes on the same WordPress page are conflicting. Each shortcode generates a unique ID but JavaScript initialization is interfering. I need isolated shortcode instances that don't conflict with each other. Show me how to create truly independent shortcode instances."

### **Admin Interface Fix**
**Prompt:** "I need a professional WordPress admin interface for my CSS Animation Builder plugin. Currently I have a basic admin page but need:
- Live animation preview
- Settings for default options
- Import/export functionality
- Animation library management
- User capability integration
- Help documentation
Create a modern WordPress admin interface following WP admin design patterns."

### **Mobile Compatibility Fix**
**Prompt:** "My CSS Animation Builder WordPress plugin animations don't work properly on mobile devices. Touch events aren't handled, animations are too fast/slow, and some effects are broken on mobile browsers. Fix mobile compatibility with proper touch handling and responsive design."

### **Security Audit Prompt**
**Prompt:** "Audit my CSS Animation Builder WordPress plugin for security vulnerabilities. Check for:
- XSS vulnerabilities in generated HTML
- SQL injection in database queries
- CSRF protection with nonces
- Input sanitization and validation
- Capability checks for admin functions
- File inclusion vulnerabilities
Provide fixes for any security issues found."
