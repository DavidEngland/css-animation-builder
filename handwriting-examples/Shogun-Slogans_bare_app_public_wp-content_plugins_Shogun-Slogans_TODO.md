# TODO - Shogun Slogans Plugin

## URGENT: Advanced SVG Animator Stability Issue

### Problem
- Advanced SVG Animator plugin became unstable after recent modifications
- Activation error occurs when trying to activate the plugin
- Error prevents the plugin from loading properly

### Impact
- Cannot use Advanced SVG Animator functionality currently
- Shogun Slogans plugin is independent and works standalone
- Users should rely on Shogun Slogans for typewriter effects until fixed

### Action Items
- [ ] Debug Advanced SVG Animator activation error when time allows
- [ ] Identify what modifications caused the instability
- [ ] Fix or rollback problematic changes
- [ ] Test thoroughly before deployment
- [ ] Consider keeping Shogun Slogans as primary typewriter solution

### Workaround
- Use Shogun Slogans plugin for all typewriter effects
- Plugin is fully functional and independent
- All needed functionality is available through shortcodes and HTML blocks

### Priority
- **Low** - Shogun Slogans provides all needed functionality
- Advanced SVG Animator can be fixed when time permits
- No immediate user impact since alternative solution exists

### Notes
- Shogun Slogans was created as typewriter-focused solution
- May be better to maintain two separate plugins anyway
- Advanced SVG Animator is complex and may benefit from simplification
