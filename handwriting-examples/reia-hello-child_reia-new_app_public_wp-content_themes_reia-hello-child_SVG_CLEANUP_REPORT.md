# SVG Icon Cleanup: simple-house-with-straight-lines.svg

## 🔧 Problem Solved
The `simple-house-with-straight-lines.svg` file was causing display issues due to its oversized dimensions (1024x1024 pixels with 2x scaling = effectively 2048x2048 pixels).

## ✅ Solution Applied
**Removed the file completely** since it was not being used in any active templates or theme functionality.

## 📂 Files Affected

### Removed:
- `/assets/svgs/simple-house-with-straight-lines.svg` (3.5KB)

### Updated Documentation:
- `/assets/REIA-SVG-USAGE-GUIDE.md` - Removed reference to the icon
- `/assets/REIA-SVG-CLEANUP-SUMMARY.md` - Updated icon count and removed example usage

## 🔍 Analysis Results
- **Templates**: No active use found in any PHP templates or template parts
- **Theme Files**: No references found in theme functionality files
- **Usage**: Only referenced in documentation files as an example

## 📊 Impact
- **Performance**: Reduced theme size by 3.5KB
- **Admin Interface**: Cleaner icon picker without oversized icon
- **User Experience**: No visual issues with oversized icons
- **Functionality**: No breaking changes (icon wasn't actually used)

## 🏠 Alternative Options
If you need a house icon in the future, you have several better options:
- Use Font Awesome: `<i class="fas fa-home"></i>`
- Use existing icons from your collections (properticons, custom-real-estate)
- Add a properly sized house icon (24x24 or 32x32 pixels)

## 🔧 Remaining Simple-Logos Collection
After cleanup, the simple-logos collection now contains:
- `logo1.svg` (1.4KB) - Properly sized logo

## ✨ Result
The theme now has a clean, consistent icon system without oversized files that could cause display issues or performance problems.
