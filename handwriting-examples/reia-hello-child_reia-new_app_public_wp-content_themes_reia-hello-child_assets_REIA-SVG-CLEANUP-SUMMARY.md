## 📱 Usage Examples

### In Templates
```php
// Properticons (perfect as always)
<?php reia_the_icon('mailbox', ['size' => '24', 'animation' => 'pulse']); ?>

// Custom real estate icons
<?php reia_the_icon('apartment', ['collection' => 'custom-real-estate', 'size' => '32']); ?>

// Simple logos
<?php reia_the_icon('logo1', ['collection' => 'simple-logos', 'size' => '48']); ?>
```

### In Content
```
[reia_icon icon="waterfront" collection="custom-real-estate" size="24"]
