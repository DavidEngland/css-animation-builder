# Large Graphics Folder

This folder contains SVG files that were moved out of the main icon collections because they are too large or complex for icon usage.

## Files Moved Here:

- `REIA-Logo.svg` (203KB) - Full detailed REIA logo
- `administrative-real-estate-services.svg` (4.8KB) - Complex service graphic
- `real-estate-contractual-relationship-options.svg` (6KB) - Complex diagram
- `real-estate-marketing-services.svg` (5.4KB) - Complex service graphic

## Why They Were Moved:

1. **File Size**: These files are too large for icon usage (should be under 3-4KB for icons)
2. **Complexity**: They contain detailed graphics, text, or multiple elements
3. **Usage**: Better suited for standalone graphics, headers, or detailed illustrations
4. **Performance**: Loading large SVGs as icons can slow down page performance

## If You Need These Files:

- Use them as standalone images: `<img src="path/to/large-graphics/REIA-Logo.svg">`
- Include them directly in templates where large graphics are needed
- Consider optimizing them with tools like SVGO if icon-sized versions are needed

## Icon-Friendly Alternatives:

The main icon collections now contain only clean, simple icons suitable for:
- Navigation elements
- Feature lists
- Contact information
- Property attributes
- UI elements

These provide better performance and visual consistency across your theme.
